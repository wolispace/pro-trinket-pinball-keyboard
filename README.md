Emulating a keyboard for playing pinball using Adafruit Trinkey Pro

Starting from this 
https://learn.adafruit.com/pro-trinket-keyboard/overview

Mapping keys A & L for flippers, Q & P for magna-savers, Space for plunger, Enter for Start and W for nudge up, and Esc.

We can send a max of three keypresses at one time so this is what we do to get both flippers up at the same time, or a flipper and the plunger.
