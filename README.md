# pro-trinket-pinball-keyboard
Emulating a keyboard for playing pinball using Adafruit Trinkey Pro

Starting from this 
https://learn.adafruit.com/pro-trinket-keyboard/overview

Mapping keys A & L for flippers, Q & P for magna-savers, Space for plunger, Enter for Start and W for nudge up.

Unlike the example code, we have to check for none of the keypresses before we release the last key pressed.
